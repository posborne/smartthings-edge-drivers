This project seeks to act as an umbrella project containing a number of
SmartThings Edge Drivers maintained by a group of community members and seeks to
be a landing spot for contributions from the larger community of SmartThings
developers and community members.

Settings this repo apart from some other projects or contributions from
individual developers are the following:

1. **Shared Ownership:** The project seeks to include several maintainers and emphasizes the
   importance of transparent contribution from multiple developers.  It is a
   reality that people's time is limited and sometimes people need to drop off a
   project.  By having multiple maintainers, the hope is that it isn't all on a
   single community developer to keep up with platform changes, bug reports, and
   new device and feature requests.
2. **Transparency:** Some popular channels on the platform today make code
   available via sharing but the source is either completely unavailable and not
   relased as open source with clear licensing or the releases are not easily
   traced back to the code.  By using CI/CD (via Github Actions), we seek to
   provide transparency and traceability so it is clear to developers and the
   community how the sausage is made and delivered.
3. **Quality:** In this repo, the goal is to have broader and more complete
   support for devices than may be offered by the first-party SmartThings
   experience but without significantly compromising on quality.  As part of
   this, unit and integration testing is a goal to include wherever it is
   reasonable to do so.
